        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            With over 6 years of experience in product design, 
            I specialize in helping companies create better products and services through effective design processes.
        </p>
        
        <p>    
            Outside of my professional endeavors, I find joy in reading books, playing the piano, recording music, 
            and living the simple life.
        </p>
        <h3>About This Website</h3>
        <p> This website serves as my digital garden, where I explore my various interest. 
            Here you'll find an array of content, including book notes, summaries, a weekly digest of 
            my musical journey, and a collection of thoughts and reflections.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I've designed this website with simplicity in mind, using minimal code for 
            easy maintenance, quick loading, and seamless navigation.
